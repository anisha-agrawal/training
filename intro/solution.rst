Introduction
------------

My name is Anisha Agrawal.
I am pursuing B.Tech in Information Technology from National Institute of Technology, Durgapur.
I currently reside in Kolkata, West Bengal, India.
I love to code and I'm interested in contributing to the FOSS community.
That's what brought me to Dgplug Summer Training 2013.

About the Summer Training
-------------------------

The training began two weeks ago and taught us something new every day. 
The first few sessions were on communication guidelines which taught us about the various communication tools used in the FOSS world and writing correct e-mails.
Then we progressed to learning the basics of command language interface (and its awesomeness!), directory structure of Linux OS (FHS), and Vim editor.
The last few sessions were on git (a distributed version control system), reStructuredText and today we started off with python, a much awaited session.

I have thoroughly enjoyed the training so far; it has helped a lot in improving my techincal skills.
I am thankful to our mentor Kushal for giving us this opportunity and for being so patient with us.

Looking forward to the coming sessions!
